# Some changes I thought would be interesting for EVE

### Remove in-space ore compression

One of the big career choices in EVE online is to become a hauler. This is actually really good way to start since probably the most important first thing to learn about EVE is the space you're flying in and it's topology.

The problem with hauling as a primary career is that beyond the lvl4 missions, there's an unbelieveable ISK wall that you have to climb to get into some of the hauling business given the collaterals.

There's nothing inbetween that and lvl4 missions. I think this is mostly because of in-space ore compression. If there was a solid set of ships that a newbie or a settling pilot could fit/fly to help high-low-null sec ore fleets as a hauler, it would go a long way in introducing haulers to the MMO side of the game as they build up their skill portfolio over time.

### Drastically increased adaptive power level of rats

Combat pilots have a similar story where the content is practically tailored for solo play until fleet combat. And EVE has a massive learning curve before you can do proper fleet play without feeling like you're constantly feeding. If there was a way to add combat pilots to be a part of a mining fleets with adaptive ratting spawns (both types and strength) depending on the size of the fleet, this could help players feel like they engage in a setting where their contribution and knowledge about ships builds up and gets gradually more and more valued.

### Remove all light drones from frigates and destroyers

I always thought that drones would be amazing way to bridge the gap between group and solo play, but their power level should be readjusted towards battleships. There's also something about light drones, their effectiveness and tracking requirement to hit them that just feels bad from both sides of play.

### Tailor PvE missions more towards group play

Missions are the first thing that people enage in, but there should be more work done in making them reward/prefer group play. I think the shared rewards are horrendous detriment right now, and the difficulty is either laughable or just a skill-gated experience.

### Selling intel and safes

It's really nice extra little content you can do on your own to fly out in a ship and set up safes in various systems and so on. But it'd be even nicer if it was made more mainstream. It's not clear from the outset that you can use scanner probes to save locations with, maybe some specific probelike drone for specialised frigate that makes that activity more explicit would go a long way, especially with a official market/interface to sell fresh intel/safes with.
